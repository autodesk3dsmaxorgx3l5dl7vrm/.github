# Autodesk 3ds Max — Windows Workflow Kit (2025)

Autodesk 3ds Max on Windows is assembled for artists and engineers who want dependable performance, predictable color, and painless interchange between tools.

This repository curates working presets, naming rules, and end‑to‑end workflows specific to **Autodesk 3ds Max** so you can move from first sketch to final frames with fewer surprises.

It focuses on Windows 10/11 tuning (drivers, caches, GPU modes) and on the IO that Autodesk 3ds Max users actually pass to other apps (USD, FBX, STEP, EXR, and more).
